# Snake Game in Java

This is a recreation of the classic Snake game using Java programming language. The game has been implemented using the Java Swing library for the graphical user interface.

## How to Play

The objective of the game is to control the snake and eat as much food as possible without colliding with the walls or the snake's own body. The game is over when the snake collides with any of these obstacles.

The snake can be controlled using the arrow keys on your keyboard. The up arrow key moves the snake up, the down arrow key moves the snake down, the left arrow key moves the snake to the left, and the right arrow key moves the snake to the right.
